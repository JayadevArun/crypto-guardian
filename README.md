# Crypto-Guardian

Crypto-Guardian is a simple graphical application built using Python and Tkinter library. The main aim of this project is to allow users to encrypt and decrypt data using the base64 encoding-decoding algorithm with an added layer of security using a secret passphrase.

Encryption Functionality:
- The application allows users to input plaintext data into a text field.
- Upon clicking the "Encrypt" button, the plaintext data is encrypted using the base64 encoding algorithm.
- The encrypted data is then displayed in a text field for the user to copy or use as needed.

Decryption Functionality:
- The application allows users to input encrypted data into a text field.
- Upon clicking the "Decrypt" button, the encrypted data is decrypted using the base64 decoding algorithm.
- The decrypted plaintext data is then displayed in a text field for the user to view or copy.
